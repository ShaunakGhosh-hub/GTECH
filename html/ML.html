                <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data. Instead of following explicit instructions, ML models identify patterns and make decisions based on the information provided to them.</p>
                <p>ML has evolved significantly and is now a core component of many technologies we use daily, including recommendation systems, voice assistants, and more.</p>

                <h2>How Does Machine Learning Work?</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning models operate by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collecting and preprocessing data.</li>
                    <li>Using algorithms to analyze patterns within the data.</li>
                    <li>Building models that can predict or classify new data points.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, a spam filter learns to classify emails as spam or not by analyzing labeled examples during its training phase.</p>

                <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>There are three main types of machine learning:</p>
                <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
                <p>In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data. Each input has a corresponding output, which the model uses as a reference. Common applications include classification and regression tasks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <p>In unsupervised learning, the model works with unlabeled data. It aims to find patterns or groupings within the data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <p>Reinforcement learning involves an agent that interacts with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent learns from rewards and penalties, optimizing its actions to maximize long-term rewards.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Training robots to walk or play games.</li>

                <h2>Common Algorithms in Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>Machine learning algorithms are mathematical methods that enable models to learn and make predictions. Here are some common ones:</p>

                <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
                <p>Linear regression is used to predict continuous outcomes. It models the relationship between input features and a target variable by fitting a linear equation to the data.</p>

                <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
                <p>Decision trees split data into branches based on feature values, making them easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.</p>

                <h3>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h3>
                <p>SVMs find the optimal boundary that separates classes in the data, making them effective for classification tasks.</p>

                <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes. They are powerful for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>Example Python Code for Linear Regression:</p>
                    <pre><code>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample Data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])  # Input features
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])         # Target variable

# Model Initialization and Training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Prediction
prediction = model.predict([[5]])
print("Prediction:", prediction)

                <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning can be categorized into three main types:</p>
                <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
                <p>Supervised learning involves training the model on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. It is widely used for tasks like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Predicting categories (e.g., email spam detection).</li>
